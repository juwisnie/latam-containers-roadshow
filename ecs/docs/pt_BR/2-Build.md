# LATAM Containers Roadshow - Workshop de Amazon ECS

[**< Voltar**](./1-Prepare.md)

## Capítulo 2 - Construindo a Infraestrutura

Now that we have everything, we need in our working environment, on this chapter we will start building the infrastructure that will host our containerized application. This workshop will explore how to leverage Amazon Elastic Compute Service (ECS) to operate containers at scale leveraging the broader AWS ecosystem and without compromising operational simplicity.

There are multiple ways to provision infrastructure on AWS, like using AWS CloudFormation, AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) or Hashicorp Terraform, but these tools will require previous knowledge and understanding of the best practices for creating and managing AWS cloud resources.
